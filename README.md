# vim-AutoClose

Appends `)`, `]`, `}` behind the cursor automatically when user types the open
counterpart. If user types it manually while the same delimiter is right
behind, it acts like pressing the `<Right>` key, thus only moves the cursor
behind the it.

Besides, typing `[<CR>` or `{<CR>`, with `]` or `}` automatically appended,
inserts an aditional blank line.
