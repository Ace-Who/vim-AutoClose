# vim-AutoPair

Appends `)`, `]`, `}` behind the cursor automatically when user types the open
counterpart.

Typing them manually while the same delimiter is right behind acts like
pressing the `<Right>` key, thus only moves the cursor behind it.

Besides, typing `[<CR>` or `{<CR>`, with `]` or `}` auto-appended, inserts an
aditional blank line.
