# vim-autoparen

Automatic `)`, `]`, `}` typing when their open counterpart is typed by user.
When user is typing them manually which is the same as the character right to the text caret, the typing is replaced with moving to the right one character.

Another thing it does happens when a newline is typed by user right after a pair of `[]` or `{}` are typed between them. What it does is inserting a blank line between the delimiter mates.
